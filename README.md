# Female_Objectification_Quantifying_in_Novels
This Repository is code for our paper: Reflecting the Male Gaze: Quantifying Female Objectification in 19th and 20th Century Novels.

## Data Introduction
The novel list used in our study comes from the 100 most popular downloaded books from [Project Gutenberg] as of August 25, 2023. We selected the novels which were published after 1800 and were written in or translated into English. Our final dataset consists of 79 novels, with `novel_79_list.txt` showing the titles of them.

## Measuring methods
Our treatment of female objectification is by defining two bias metrics:
1. **Agency Bias**: A text exhibits agency bias if male entities are more likely than female entities to appear in the text as grammatical agents.
2. **Appearance Bias**: A text exhibits appearance bias if “female” words are distributionally closer to “appearance” words than “male” words.

More explaination of this two concepts can be found in our paper.
